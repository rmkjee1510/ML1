House Price Prediction 
The Project is dedicated to predicting housing prices through the application of regression analysis, with a focus on the renowned Boston Housing Dataset. This dataset comprises various factors that influence housing prices, such as crime rate, room count, accessibility to highways, and more.

By employing regression techniques, including linear regression, the project aims to establish a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on its features. Through thorough analysis and training on the Boston Housing Dataset, the model learns the relationships between the input features and housing prices. This enables it to generalize its understanding to new, unseen data.

The project's primary objective is to offer valuable insights to real estate professionals, potential buyers, and sellers alike. It empowers stakeholders with the ability to make informed decisions by providing estimated housing prices that align with market trends. Additionally, the project showcases the practical application of machine learning in the real estate industry, demonstrating its potential to streamline decision-making processes and improve overall accuracy in housing price predictions.
